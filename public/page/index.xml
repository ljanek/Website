      <description>Welcome I have been teaching myself R for a few years, largely through the great resources at DataCamp and other online courses, and working on a few projects on my own. I hope to use this site to share what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned and to connect with and learn from others.
I&amp;rsquo;m a Program Analyst for the Federal Government (views here are entirely my own), and I have a background in health policy.</description>
