## Welcome

I have been teaching myself R for a few years, largely through the great resources at [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/home) and other online courses, and working on a few projects on my own. I hope to use this site to share what I've learned and to connect with and learn from others. 

I'm a Program Analyst for the Federal Government (views here are entirely my own), and I have a background in health policy. I live in the Washington, DC area, and am originally from Pittsburgh, PA.
